Course-Material
===============

This repository contains the Course Material for two Android Bootcamps. The first is the Android Bootcamp for Beginners. This course is aimed at people who want to learn the basics of Android. The second is called Test Driven Development (TDD) on Android. This is aimed at people with intermediate to expert Android knowledge, and who want to learn how to apply TDD on Android. Both courses are described in detail below.

The material on GitHub would ideally be used with a facilitator and is not as effective for self study, although it's certainly a resource. We're trying to get to a point where it can be used for self study. Any advice and help is appreciated. If you've taught before, and want to advise us on organising the resources, or would like to help us enhance the material, create tutorials or videos, please get in touch!

Test Driven Development (TDD) on Android
----------------------------------------

This course also runs over 3 days, and contains 6 sessions of 3 hours each. It is recommended that you plan for a lunch break of atleast 45 minutes in between. 
This course builds a conference application over three days, covering various TDD concepts on the way.
We generally conduct a retrospective towards the end of session 5, or the beginning of session 6, but gather feedback at the end of each day. 

Here is what each of the sessions cover -  

Session 1 - Basics of TDD. Unit Tests, Test Fixtures, Test Pyramid, JUnit, and a simple graph problem to practice TDD. You can skip this session if the crowd is already familiar with the basics of TDD.
