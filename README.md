Course-Material
===============

This the Course Material Repository for the beginner's Android Bootcamp. It contains presentations for all the 6 sessions.  
Each session is 3 hours, and it is recommended you have 2 sessions per day, with a 45 minute lunch break in between.  
The last session is smaller, around 1.5 hours.  
We generally conduct a retrospective towards the end of session 5, or the beginning of session 6.  

Here are what each of the sessions cover -  
Session 1 - Basics of Android, project structure, Activities, Layouts, Activity Lifecycle, Explicit Intents, Navigation Using Intents, Gradle Plugin.  
Session 2 - Implicit Intents, Explicit and Implicit Activation, Intent Filters, Camera Integration, SQL.  
Session 3 - Adapters and Adapter Views, RecyclerView, Themes.  
Session 4 - Async Calls, Activity Recreation.  
Session 5 - Fragments, Fragment Lifecycle, View Pagers.  
Session 6 - Broadcast Receivers, Intercepting SMS Messages.  

The coding assignments are under the following repositories - 

Day 1 - https://github.com/androidbootcamp/ProjectPlanner under branch - solution  
Day 2 - https://github.com/androidbootcamp/ShoppingApplication under branch - solution  
Day 3 - https://github.com/androidbootcamp/smsinterceptor under branch - solution  

The material on GitHub would ideally be used with a facilitator and is not as effective for self study, although it's certainly a resource. We're trying to get to a point where it can be used for self study. Any advice and help is appreciated. If you've taught before, and want to advise us on organising the resources, or would like to help us enhance the material, create tutorials or videos, please get in touch!
